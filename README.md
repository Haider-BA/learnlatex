#What is LaTeX?

LaTeX is a document preparation system.  A document is prepared in a "markup language" and is then rendered into a completed document, most commonly as a pdf.  

#Installing/Using LaTeX

To use LaTeX, you need both an editor and a compiler.  The editor can be any standard code editor although you may prefer using one that has LaTeX support (shortcuts, autocomplete, etc...).  I've used [Texmaker](http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/download.html) in the past and think it's pretty good.  


##Online

Use an online editor and compiler.  Both [ShareLatex](http://sharelatex.com) and [WriteLatex](http://writelatex.com) are free and work well.  The only caveat is that you'll have to upload your figures to the sites in order to insert them into your documents.  

##Install locally

###Windows
I recommend using MiKTeX on Windows.  The download page is [here](http://www.miktex.org/2.9/setup).  If you are using a machine in a lab, you probably don't have administrator rights, but you can still install and use the MiKTeX Portable version available on the download page.  

###Mac
Download and install the [MacTex Package](http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/mac/mactex/MacTeX.mpkg.zip).  This may require admin rights. 

###Linux
Your distribution almost certainly has a LaTeX package available.  Use your package manager to download and install it.  

#Getting started

Now that you have an editor and compiler installed, let's get started.  

First, download [HelloWorld.tex]().  This is a very simple .tex document that you can compile to make sure everything is working on your end.
